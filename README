2) Windows

If you simply want to use SODA a precompiled version of SODA is available here :
http://thevenon.julien.free.fr/soda/download/soda_win32_binaries.tar.gz

If you want to build soda you will need to install the following:
	* Msys : http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS
	* MinGW : http://www.mingw.org/
	* Qt4.7.4 at least : http://qt.digia.com
IMPORTANT : please ensure that gdb version is at leat 4.1.1

# BUILD
#--------

1) Linux

To build all objects : soda Graphical Interface, soda command line, soda modules etc
* Excute script build_Linux.sh

If you want to rebuild a particular object
* cd build/<object_name>
* make ( for soda_batch or soda_QtUi ) make library ( for SODA modules)

2) Windows

To build soda_batch and soda modules
* Launch msys command to obtain an Msys terminal
* take place in directory containing README
* Execute script build_MinGW.sh with the command : . MinGW_build.sh
It should build everything needed for batch mode and launch an example

If you want to rebuild a particular object
* cd build/<object_name>
* make ( for soda_batch or soda_QtUi ) make library ( for SODA modules)

To build soda_QtUi the SODA Graphical Interface the previous step should have been done.
*  Take place in Qt_build directory
*  Open soda_QtUi.pro with QtCreator
*  Click on finish in the dialog window
*  Build the project

# RUN EXAMPLES
#--------------

1) Linux

Go inside examples directory.
In each example directory there is 
* a run_batch.sh script that allows to run the example in batch mode
* a run_gui.sh that allows to run the example in GUI mode. Once the GUI launched
  Open the provided configuration file and then click on Start button

2) Windows

Go inside examples directory.
In each example directory there is 
* a run_batch.bat script that allows to run the example in batch mode
* a run_gui.bat that allows to run the example in GUI mode. Once the GUI launched
